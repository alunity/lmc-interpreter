All these examples and their example machine code outputs are taken from https://www.yorku.ca/sychen/research/LMC/

# Examples expected behaviour

## Example 1

- Takes input
- Outputs the input

## Example 2

- Takes 2 inputs
- Outputs the the 2 inputs in the same order

## Example 3

- Takes 3 inputs
- Adds the first two inputs together and outputs the result
- Subtracts the first input from the third input and outputs the result

## Example 4

- Takes 2 inputs
- Outputs the largest of the two inputs

## Example 5

- Outputs the numbers 1-10 inclusive

## Example 6

- Takes 1 input
- If input is not a triangular number, output 0
- If input is a triangular number, output which triangular number it is
- The first is 1, the second is 3, the third is 6, etc.

# Test format

- Each line represents a test case
- Inputs and outputs are separated by a colon `:`
- Either side of the colon, the inputs and outputs are separated by spaces
